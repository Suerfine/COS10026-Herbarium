			<h2>Plant taxonomy is the science that finds, identifies, describes, classifies, and names plants. Plants can be classified into:</h2>

				<figcaption>Plant classification of the Fagaceae family</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<dl>
				<dt>Family</dt>
				<dd>
					This is the highest classification group normally referred to. Each member of a plant family shares many botanical features.
					Modern classification assigns a type of plant to each family as an example of that family’s characteristics as distinguishable from other families. The names of families end in "aceae."
				</dd>
				<dt>Genus</dt>
				<dd>
					This is the part of plant nomenclature that is the most familiar. For example, Papaver is the genus for Poppy. Plants in a genus are
					easily recognizable as belonging to the same group. The name of the genus should always be capitalized. Example: Red Poppy is Papaver rhoeas.
				</dd>
				<dt>Species</dt>
				<dd>
					This is the level of classification that defines the individual plant. Here some aspects of the plant are more specifically defined — color, leaf shape,
					or place where or by whom it was discovered. The use of the genus and species names together always refer to only one plant.

		<p class="classify-p">
		Lauraceae, or the laurels, is a plant family that includes the true laurel and its closest relatives.
		This family comprises about 2850 known species in about 45 genera worldwide.They are dicotyledons,
		and occur mainly in warm temperate and tropical regions, especially Southeast Asia and South America.
		Many are aromatic evergreen trees or shrubs, but some, such as Sassafras, are deciduous,
		or include both deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs, especially in tropical and temperate climates.
		The genus Cassytha is unique in the Lauraceae in that its members are parasitic vines. Most laurels are highly poisonous.</p>
		
		<h2 class="classify-h2">Genera</h2>
		<p class="classify-p">
			Because the family is so ancient and was so widely distributed on the Gondwana supercontinent,
			modern species commonly occur in relict populations isolated by geographical barriers, for instance on islands or tropical mountains.
			Relict forests retain endemic fauna and flora in communities of great value in inferring 
			the palaeontological succession and climate change that followed the breakups of the supercontinents..

		<h1 class="classify-h1">Species</h1>
		
		<p class="classify-p">
		The leaves of some species in the Lauraceae have domatia in the axils of their veins. The domatia are home to certain mites. Other lauraceous species,
		members of the genus Pleurothyrium in particular, have a symbiotic relationship with ants 
		that protect and defend the tree. Some Ocotea species are also used as nesting sites by ants, which may live in leaf pockets 
		or in hollowed-out stems Defense mechanisms that occur among members of the Lauraceae include irritant or toxic sap or tissues that repel or poison many herbivorous organisms.</p>
